libscrappy-perl (0.94112090-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  TODO:
  - please forward the patch upstream and add the URL
  - (aesthetic) I usually use "$(RM) -v" instead of "rm" in debian/rules;
    -v is nice to see if actually something is removed; ok, with plain "rm" we
    got an error otherwise :)

  * Initial Release. (Closes: #717907)
