  TODO:
  - when I set TEST_LIVE, the package fails to build. The error I get is:

        t/00_test_function_content.t ............ ok

        #   Failed test at t/00_test_function_control.t line 11.

        #   Failed test at t/00_test_function_control.t line 12.

        #   Failed test at t/00_test_function_control.t line 13.
        Exiting subroutine via next at lib/Scrappy/Scraper/Control.pm line 53.
        Can't "next" outside a loop block at lib/Scrappy/Scraper/Control.pm line 53.
        # Looks like you planned 12 tests but ran 7.
        # Looks like you failed 3 tests of 7 run.
        # Looks like your test exited with 255 just after 7.
        t/00_test_function_control.t ............ 
        Dubious, test returned 255 (wstat 65280, 0xff00)
        Failed 8/12 subtests 

    The '"next" outside a loop block' does indeed look very wrong (should this
    be 'return'?), but why is that code path hit in the first place?

  - Debian is going to transition to Perl 5.18 very soon, but
    https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=82142 indicates that this
    package is not ready. Can you investigate?

  * Initial Release. (Closes: #717907)
