libscrappy-perl (0.94112090-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  NOTES, QUESTIONS, TODOS:
  - maybe this package should be named snappy?
    depends on if /usr/bin/snappy is the main element or the modules.
    cf. http://pkg-perl.alioth.debian.org/policy.html#package_naming_policy
  - ./usr/share/perl5/perltidy.pl looks weird. should probably be removed from
    the binary package.
  - spelling.patch: Bug:/Forwarded: missing
  - d/control: Depends is too empty ...
  - d/copyright: missing year(s) of upstream copyright

  * Initial Release. (Closes: #717907)
